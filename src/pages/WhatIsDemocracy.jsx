      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold mb-4'>What Is Democracy, Really?</h2>
      <p className='mb-4'>At its core, democracy is a political system where power rests with the people. Derived from the Greek words <em>demos</em> (people) and <em>kratos</em> (rule), democracy is fundamentally about collective decision-making. But it’s more than just voting every few years.</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>Modern democracies rely on a set of core principles: free and fair elections, protection of individual rights, the rule of law, and a system of checks and balances. These ensure that leaders remain accountable and that power doesn’t concentrate dangerously in one place.</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>There are two broad types: direct democracy, where citizens vote on laws directly (think ancient Athens), and representative democracy, where elected officials make decisions on the people’s behalf (like India or the U.S.).</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>But democracy isn’t just a system—it’s a culture. It thrives on public participation, informed debate, press freedom, and active civil society. And it demands a literate, engaged, and critical citizenry.</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>However, democracy is not without flaws. Voter apathy, misinformation, populism, and elite capture often undermine its functioning. Also, simply holding elections doesn’t make a country democratic—many regimes mimic democratic forms while hollowing out its substance.</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>So, when we talk about democracy, we must look beyond the ballot box. True democracy is judged not only by the institutions in place but by how power is distributed, voices are heard, and rights are protected—even for the weakest.</p>
      <p className='mt-6 font-semibold'>In short: Democracy is not a destination, but a continuous, collective effort to share power wisely.</p>
